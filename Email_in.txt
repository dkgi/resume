Dear Sir or Madam,

I recently received my Master's Degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich and I am currently considering pursuing a PhD position. But first I would like to get some further practical experience and I am therefore highly interested in an internship position at COMPANY.

I have attached my resume and the transcript of my Bachelor's as well as my Master's Degree and would be honored if you would consider my application.

Yours faithfully,
Dominik Gabi
