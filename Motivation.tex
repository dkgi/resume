  \textbf{Application Regarding a Position as \objective}

	\iftoggle{contact}{Dear \contact,}{Dear Sir or Madam,}

  I recently received my Master's Degree in Computer Science from ETH Z\"urich and I am currently looking for my first employment as an \position.

  During my graduate studies I worked on software verification and concurrency. I had exposure to current topics in software verification with model checking (\emph{PROMELA/SPIN}), separation logic (\emph{VeriFast}) and abstract interpretation as well as cutting edge topics in concurrency (\emph{SCOOP}). For my Master's Thesis I implemented the \emph{Trace Partitioning Abstract Domain}\footnote{for more information and links see my CV} for the static analyzer \emph{Sample}. 
  
  I am interested in a wide range of topics within computer science (graphics, simulations and formal methods in general) as well as outside the field where topics range from economics to physics etc. However, first and foremost, I enjoy thinking and reasoning about program architecture and correctness, a quality widely applicable not just in software engineering. \companyspecific Moreover, I am eager to to broaden my horizon and to work in an diverse environment. I think I would make a valuable addition to your team.

  \iftoggle{cds}{Please note that I would apply for a \emph{J-1} visa through CDS International,\footnote{\url{http://www.cdsintl.org/interntrainusa/}} which would act as my legal sponsor providing health and travel insurance for the duration of the internship.}


  I hope I have raised your interest in my person and look forward to hearing from you soon.
